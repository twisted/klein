    HTTP entity headers.

    HTTP headers names and values are sort-of-but-not-quite-specifically
    expected to be text.

    Because the specifications are somewhat vague, and implementations vary in
    fidelity, both header names and values must be made available as the
    original bytes received from the network.
    This interface also makes them available as an ordered sequence of name and
    value pairs so that they can be iterated in the same order as they were
    received on the network.

    As such, the C{rawHeaders} attribute provides the header data as a sequence
    of C{(name, value)} L{tuple}s.

    A dictionary-like interface that maps text names to an ordered sequence of
    text values.
    This interface assumes that both header name bytes and header value bytes
    are encoded as ISO-8859-1.

    Note that header name bytes should be strictly encoded as ASCII; this
    interface uses ISO-8859-1 to provide interoperability with (naughty) HTTP
    implementations that send non-ASCII data.
    Because ISO-8859-1 is a superset of ASCII, this will still work for
    well-behaved implementations.
