    Retrieve a transaction that is bound to the lifecycle of the given request.

    There are three use-cases for this lifecycle:

        1. 'normal CRUD' - a request begins, a transaction is associated with

           appropriate time to commit the transaction is the moment before the
           first byte goes out to the client.  The appropriate moment to
           interpose this commit is in `Request.write`, at the moment where
           it's about to call channel.writeHeaders, since the HTTP status code
           should be an indicator of whether the transaction succeeded or
           failed.

        2. 'just the session please' - a request begins, a transaction is
           associated with it in order to discover the session, and the
           application code in question isn't actually using the database.
           (Ideally as expressed through "the dependency-declaration decorator,
           such as @authorized, did not indicate that a transaction will be
           required").

        3. 'fancy API stuff' - a request begins, a transaction is associated
           with it in order to discover the session, the application code needs
           to then do I{something} with that transaction in-line with the
           session discovery, but then needs to commit in order to relinquish
           all database locks while doing some potentially slow external API
           calls, then start a I{new} transaction later in the request flow.
